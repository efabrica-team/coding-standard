### Usage
```shell
composer require efabrica/coding-standard --dev
vendor/bin/phpcs {dirs} --standard="vendor/efabrica/coding-standard/eFabrica" {other-options}
```

> for {dirs} use space-separated list of directories \
> for {other-options} see `vendor/bin/phpcs --help` or visit [PHP_CodeSniffer documentation](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)

## eFabricaStrict coding standard
Is based on eFabrica coding standard and adds some strict rules:

1. Use `declare(strict_types=1);` at the top of each PHP file. Use one empty line before and also after declare

1. Disallows using mixed typehint in phpdoc

### Usage
```shell
composer require efabrica/coding-standard --dev
vendor/bin/phpcs {dirs} --standard="vendor/efabrica/coding-standard/eFabricaStrict" {other-options}
```

> for {dirs} use space-separated list of directories \
> for {other-options} see `vendor/bin/phpcs --help` or visit [PHP_CodeSniffer documentation](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
